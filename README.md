Here we can see some of the projects I have done during my Digital Image Processing course <br /> spring 2021

## ðŸ”– Homework 1 
- Goal: Find the best filter to eemove the image noise 
- Applying the listed filters on the image to see what will happen: 
       1. Averaging filter
       2. Median filter
       3. Laplacian filter
- performing power-law transformation on the image
- As expected ,The Median filtered output image was the best result.
- Generally , Median filterscan be a good choice for reducing salt or pepper noise on the image
- We can see That salt noise is removed,and the image is much brighter after using Median filter

## ðŸ”– Homework 2
- Goal: Motion detection while comparing three images taken by NASA
- Applying bit plane slicing
- Motion detection
- Bit plane slicing on the image of an electrical board

- Motion Detection : We compared 3 images with the help of their mostsignificate planes extracted through Bit plane slicing 
- As we can see the difference of image NASA_B and NASA_C includes more white points, So the object movement was more considerable

## ðŸ”– Homework 3
- Goal: Detect Cells in this biomedical image by applying a circle detection algorithm
- Applying Canny filter to find the best parameters that can detect the borders of circles
- Use those parameters in Hough circle transformation

## ðŸ”– Homework 4
- Goal: Reconstruct the original image from the transformed image
- Choose three landmarks 
- Find the affine transformation matrix to reconstruct the original image
