Here we can see some of the projects I have done during my Digital Image Processing course <br /> spring 2021

## ðŸ”– Homework 1
- Applying the listed filters on the image to see what will happen: 
       1. Averaging filter
       2. Median filter
       3. Laplacian filter
- performing power-law transformation on the image
- As expected ,The Median filtered output image was the best result.
- Generally , Median filterscan be a good choice for reducing salt or pepper noise on the image
- We can see That salt noise is removed,and the image is much brighter after using Median filter
